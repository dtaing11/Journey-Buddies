## Inspiration
Journey Buddies was inspired by a love for travel and a desire to build connections across cultures. We wanted to create a platform that would help travelers explore new places, learn about different cultures, and make meaningful connections with locals and fellow adventurers.

## What it does
Journey Buddies connects travelers with other explorers around the world. Users can create profiles, create groups, join existing groups, find events and use the map feature to navigate and plan their trips. With features like real-time chat, Journey Buddies makes international travel more exciting and adventurous. 

## How we built it
We used **HTML**, and **CSS** for the frontend, creating a responsive and interactive user interface. We used**JavaScript** for the backend and **Firebase** handles our user authentication and data storage needs, keeping user information secure and accessible. We integrated **OpenStreetMap** to provide location-based services, allowing users to find relevant connections and navigate their journeys easily.

## Challenges we ran into
Building a global platform came with unique challenges. We needed to manage secure data handling with Firebase, optimize location-based services through OpenStreetMap, and create a reliable user experience that works across various cultures and regions. Ensuring that our platform was intuitive and accessible for a diverse audience required extensive planning and iteration. We wanted to integrate our Reels option; however, it was more time-consuming than we imagined so we saved that for our future additions to our project, as we wanted to focus our time and energy on more necessary aspects of our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Weâ€™re proud to have built a platform that fosters cross-cultural connections and helps travelers explore the world with confidence. Successfully integrating Firebase for secure user authentication and implementing OpenStreetMap for seamless navigation were significant achievements that made Journey Buddies a practical tool for travelers.

## What we learned
Through this project, we learned a lot about frontend development, secure data management with Firebase, and location-based features with OpenStreetMap. We also gained a deeper understanding of the importance of inclusivity and user experience design for a global audience.

## What's next for Journey Buddies
In the future, we aim to expand Journey Buddies with more personalized features, such as tailored travel recommendations, group travel planning options, and in-depth cultural guides. We also hope to add support for more languages to make the platform even more accessible to travelers worldwide. We also hope to properly integrate our Reels feature once we have more time and resources.
